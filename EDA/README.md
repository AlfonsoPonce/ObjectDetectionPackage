# Exploratory Data Analysis Module
## Main goal
This module performs Exploratory Data Analysis in order to generate a report.
This report will be useful for establishing some preprocessing steps.


# :warning: IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION :warning:
_Data must stand in _Data/_ folder. Each subfolder below _Data/_ describes a unique task.
Below _Data/task_X/_ data will be versioned. For example, initial dataset directory tree could be:
_Data/task_X/raw_data_. Inside the last directory, data will be splitted into
_images/_ and _labels_ [NO TRAIN/VAL/DATA SPLITTING]._

_This job is not done by the module._
